## Want to block all users of a group on fetlife?

Sometimes theres a whole group of people on fetlife who you don't wish to interact with. Maybe a few hundred. Unfortunately, blocking them all by hand is VERY time consuming. This project was designed to run in the browser.

## How do I do it

1. Using a browser (tested only on Google Chrome) login to Fetlife **in a different tab than the one on this page**.
2. Now visit the group you want to block all users from.
3. Press the `F12` key on your keyboard to open the console.
4. In another tab, open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dontyouwantawanta/fet_group_blocker/refs/heads/main/blocker.js and copy all of the content.
5. Paste it in the Google Chrome Console and hit `enter`. If you are prompted to type `allow pasting` first, type that in. You may need to paste and hit `enter` again.
6. Watch as the script loops through each page of the group and blocks each user!

## It didn't work, what do I do?

If you know the creator, DM them.

If you don't, hopen an issue on here. Copy the output from the console, none of it is sensitive so no worry.
